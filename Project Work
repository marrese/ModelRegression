###**1. Management Summary**

What is better in terms of mileage: automatic or manual trasmission car? In other words is the gear type relevant for car performance and at what extent?.
Using a dataset of 32 car models circulating in 1973-1974 a data analysis has been carried out by mean of Regression Modeling.
The work shows a statistical difference in terms of gear type. Furthermore car efficiency depend also to  some additional factors - weight, acceleration force, also in interaction.
According to the analyzed data.ase we can affirm that manual car shows better result in efficiency, particularly joined or in he transmission typeâ€“and other factors about the car show a high probability of being more strongly related to the mileage.
 model on the dataset with the efficiency as the outcome so we could quantify the weight of each factor in the car efficiency.

The content of this paper is as follows:

* An prelimiary exploratory Data Analysis (par.2)

* A rational about Model Regression carried out (par.3)

* Supporting figures (par.4.1)

* The code used during the execution is outlined in par 4.2.


###**2. Exploratory Analysis**
####**2.1 Basic summary of data**
The  dataset mtcars describe 11 characteristics of 32 car models. 
The distribution of model grouped by transmission type (am) has different shape (see Appendix Fig.1.a), where the manual type A first exploratory analysis shows a gain in efficiency in manual cars over automatic ones , and this difference is also evident in the boxplot comparation (see Fig.1.b).

Manual cars had a mean efficiency of 24.39 miles per gallon (sd= 6.16) while automatic models had a mean of 17.15 (sd=3.83).


####**2.2 Data comparison using Confidence Interval and Hypotesis tests**
Considering te different means, it would be useful to test if these mean are acceptable: 
Hypothesing that this sample comes from a normal distribution, a subset of the population would have a t-student distribution. To confirm the difference in efficiency of both car models, may be useful to apply a simples t-test for rejecting the null hypothesis that both sets have the same efficiency. The test rejected the null hypothesis with a 95% confidence (p-value = 0.0014) (see results in 4.2.2)

###**3. Regression Models**
Since it is requested to find a possible relation of efficiency (mpg) with transmission type (am), the latter must be present in any model to be found.
####**3.1 Simple Linear Regression**
A simple linear regression is tempted to find a direct and unique correlation with transmission type.
```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
fit0=lm(mpg~am, data=mtcars)
summary(fit0)$coefficients
```
The coefficient of 7.245 indicates that a manual transmission should imply an mpg increase of 7.245 miles per gallon. The t value and residual variation shows also that the model is a poor fit (see 4.2.4). Even the Adjusted R-squared value (0.3385) indicates a poor explaination of variance of dependente variable mpg. Regarding the regression process the regressor am has beenn taken as is since a factorization is useless.
